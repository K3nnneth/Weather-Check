# Weather-Check

Created a weather web app utilizing WeatherAPIâ€™s API, enabling users to effortlessly obtain real-time weather information for specific locations through a user-friendly interface. Used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There is a check box that can toggle the temperature to display in farenheit or celsius.
